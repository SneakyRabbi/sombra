Sombra Overwatch ARG
====================

Sombra ARG repository for various tools

The goal here is to verify ALL clues found in the ARG in such a way that:

1. All conclusions are reproducible and verifiable by others
2. All tools used are open source or freely accessible

1. [Ana Origin Video](00-ana-origin-video) - Solved / Verified
2. [Dev Update Video](01-dev-update-video) - Solved / Unverified
3. [Summer Games Video](02-summer-games-video) - Unsolved
